Welcome to the CS3220 Course!

Each assignment will consist a notebook file(s) (with a .ipynb extension) and might (or not) consist several normal Python files (with .py extension).
The notebooks will serve as the driver of the assignments.
They will direct you to implement tasks (as functions and classes).
You might be required (not always) to implement a few ones in the .py files, which you will then import into the notebook to perform computation.

This requires a bit of setup.
0. Create a New Repository (cs3220_fall2025_NWP) on GitHub

1. Create a Virtual Environment for your Project in VSCode:
   1.1 Open a new VSCode session
   1.2 Open the Project in VSCode
     - clone a repository (you will be provided with a link) & open it in your workspace
   OR
     - download the assignment zip-file and unpack its content with a starter code(s) and a notebook(s) in your working folder
    1.3 Create a Python Virtual Environment
    1.4 Activate the virtual environment
    1.5 Install your desired dependencies
    1.6 Save Dependencies to requirements.txt (optional)
    1.7 Select Python Interpreter
    1.8 Creating a .gitignore File
       Add the following lines to your .gitignore file:
          .venv/
          .env
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
