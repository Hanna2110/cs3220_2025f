Welcome to the CS3220 Course!

Each assignment will consist a notebook file(s) (with a .ipynb extension) and might (or not) consist several normal Python files (with .py extension).
The notebooks will serve as the driver of the assignments.
They will direct you to implement tasks (as functions and classes).
You might be required (not always) to implement a few ones in the .py files, which you will then import into the notebook to perform computation.
